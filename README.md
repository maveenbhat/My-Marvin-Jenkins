Jenkins is the most popular Open Source automation platform.

It can automate any task you want, from simple periodic cleanups to full production-scaled deployments. Therefore, it allows to setup the cornerstone of the DevOps chain: the Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (or Continuous Deployment) pipeline.
You might also have already read or heard about it, going by the name of CI/CD pipeline.

During this project, I have worked on the art of automating your everyday developer tasks with Jenkins.

Throughout this project I have used Configuration as Code (a.k.a. JCasC), which allows you to describe your entire desired Jenkins configuration in just a single YAML file.

I have also used the Job Domain Specific Language (a.k.a. Job DSL) in order to create elements such as jobs.
